# 🧠 42cursus - Exam Rank 04

This repository contains my solutions for the 42cursus **Exam Rank 04**, which is composed of three levels of increasingly difficult coding exercises.

---

## 🧩 Level 1

### ✅ `n_queens`
- **Goal**: Print all valid solutions to the N-Queens problem (placing N queens on an N×N board such that none threaten each other).
- **Input**: A single argument `n` (number of queens).
- **Output**: Each solution is a sequence of row positions for each column.

### ✅ `permutation`
- **Goal**: Print all permutations of a given string, accounting for possible duplicates.
- **Constraints**: No use of external libraries or sorting functions.

### ✅ `power_set`
- **Goal**: Print the power set (all possible subsets) of a given string in lexicographic order.
- **Details**: Recursively generates all combinations, sorts them, and prints.

### ✅ `rip`
- **Goal**: From a string of parentheses, remove the **minimum number of invalid** parentheses to make the string balanced.
- **Output**: All possible valid strings after minimal edits.

### ✅ `tsp` (Traveling Salesman Problem)
- **Goal**: Solve the TSP using brute-force (recursively trying all possible paths).
    Input: Distance matrix of the cities.
- **Output**: Minimum cost path and its total distance.

## ⚙️ Level 2

### ✅ `ft_popen`
- **Goal**: Implement a simplified version of `popen()` to execute shell commands via `fork`, `pipe`, and `execvp`.
- **Focus**: Pipe setup, file descriptor management, and process control.

### ✅ `picoshell`
- **Goal**: Build a tiny shell that parses a string of piped commands (e.g., `ls | grep a | wc -l`) and executes them correctly.
- **Key Concepts**: `fork`, `execvp`, `pipe`, `dup2`, command parsing.

### ✅ `sandbox`
- **Goal**: Detect whether a function crashes, hangs (timeout), or exits normally.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - `fork()`, `alarm()`, `sigaction()`
  - Detecting segmentation faults or timeouts
  - Analyzing `waitpid` exit statuses

---

## 🌲 Level 3

### ✅ `argo`
- **Goal**: Parse a simplified JSON-like input string into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Parser Type**: Recursive Descent
- **Output**: Structured tree representing objects, arrays, strings, and numbers.

### ✅ `vbc` (Very Basic Compiler)
- **Goal**: Implement a compiler that converts arithmetic expressions (`+`, `*`, parentheses) into stack-based assembly-like instructions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Tokenization
  - AST construction
  - Recursive code generation

---

## 📌 Notes

- All projects are implemented in **C**, without using external libraries unless explicitly allowed.
- Each level had a strict time constraint during the exam.
- The repository is organized into folders by level, each containing source code and test cases.

---

## 📚 Learnings

- Mastery of recursion, backtracking, and tree structures.
- Deep understanding of Unix process control (`fork`, `exec`, `pipe`, `wait`).
- Writing parsers and compilers from scratch without libraries.
- Low-level error handling and debugging using signals and system calls.

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

Exam Rank 04 was a significant step in mastering complex algorithmic thinking and system-level C programming. These exercises helped sharpen my skills in recursion, parsing, memory management, and inter-process communication.
